# Web-Scraper
Getting headlines, summaries, and articles from yahoo finance and other stock market sites in the future

to do: 
  - make getSummaries more readable
    -replace most of the special charaacters (&amp to the character "&")
  - make rmAngles better by having it remove everything between angle brackets at once instead of checking each individual character and introduce a find_all() method that can find all the indexes of all the times a certain substring appears in a string
